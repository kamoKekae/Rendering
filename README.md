# Rendering
In this repository I aim to make a simple raytracer. This will be done following a list of blogs, tutorials and books which will be the material used in my learning.

# Material
Most of the learning material will be taken from the following repo : https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x#build-your-own-3d-renderer
